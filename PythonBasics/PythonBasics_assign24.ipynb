    "- In python, def defined functions are commonly used because of their simplicity. The def defined functions do not return anything if not explicitly returned whereas the lambda function does return an object. The def functions must be declared in the namespace. The def functions can perform any python task including multiple conditions, nested conditions or loops of any level, printing, importing libraries, raising Exceptions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The lambda functions can be used without any declaration in the namespace. The lambda functions defined above are like single-line functions. These functions do not have parenthesis like the def defined functions but instead, take parameters after the lambda keyword as shown above. There is no return keyword defined explicitly because the lambda function does return an object by default.\n"
