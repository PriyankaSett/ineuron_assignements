    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : `shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder. It primarily takes two arguments `src` and `dest`. `src` represents the file to be copied where as `dest` refers to the file/folder to where the `src` data should be copied. If `dest` is a folder name the `src` with exact name will be copied to the `dest` folder whereas if its a file then the contents of `src` will be copied to `dest` where `dest` retains it name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. It also takes two arguments `src` & `dest`. It copies all the content recursively and stores it in `dest`. The important point to note here is that `dest` must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using `copy_function` attribute."

    "2. What function is used to rename files?? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : `os.rename()` function is used to rename files or directories using a python program. this function takes two arguments `src` and `dest`. `src` represents the name file/directory which we want to rename, whereas `dest` represents the new name of the file/directory."

    "3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : `Shutil` module provides a funciton called as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all of its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are `os.remove()` which removes a file. `os.rmdir()` removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently and if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where as `send2trash` module provides a function called `send2trash.send2trash()` to delete a file/directory. These methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. Hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally using the `send2trash.send2trash()` it can be still recovered from trash folder. `send2trash` is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules. So, it needs to be installed explicitly using the command `!pip install send2trash`."
