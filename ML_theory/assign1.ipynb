    "**1. What does one mean by the term &quot;machine learning&quot;?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans :  'Machine learning' is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Machine learning algorithms had good results in healthcare, auto-drive cars, logistics and retails. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : A labelled training set is a set of data that corresponds to a particular results, 'Label'. This kind of data set is used in supervised problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Regression and Classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Clustering certain groups like, social segment analysis, market segmentation etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various\n",
    "unfamiliar terrains?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Reinforced learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : If the data is labelled, one should perform supervised classification analysis, e.g.- Logistic Regression, Ensemble techniques or Deep Learning Techniques. If the data is not labelled, one should use unsupervised technique to peform classification, e.g. Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What is the concept of an online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : An online learning system learns from new data on-the-fly. As a result, the system is trained incrementally either by using one example at a time or using a mini-batch approach. This keeps each learning step cheap and memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Out-of-core learning is used when a dataset is too large to fit into a computer's memory. The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step, then repeats the process until it has run on all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Instance-based learning algorithms use a measure of similarity to generalize to new cases. In an instance-based learning system, the algorithm learns the examples by heart, then uses the similarity measure to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. What&#39;s the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm, not the model. For example, in a simple linear regression problem our model is parameterized by theta which is a vector of weights. In order to find the best values for theta we have to minimize a cost function using the gradient descent algorithm. Gradient descent has a hyperparameter called alpha which is the learning rate of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Not gathering enough data, or sampling noise. Sampling noise means we'll have non-representative data as a result of chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using a dataset that is not representative of the cases you want to generalize to. This is called sampling bias. For example, if you want to train an algorithm with \"cat videos\", and all your videos are from YouTube, you're actually training an algorithm to learn about \"YouTube cat videos.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Your dataset is full of missing values, outliers, and noise (poor measurments).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The features in your dataset are irrelevant. Garbage in, garbage out.\n",
    "        - Feature selection - choose the most relevant features from your dataset\n",
    "        - Feature extraction - combine features in your dataset to generate a new, more useful feature\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When your model performs well on the training data, but not on test data, you've over fit your model. Models that suffer from overfitting do not generalize well to new examples. Overfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the data.\n",
    "        - Try simplyfying the model by reducing the number of features in the data or constraining the parameters by reducing the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "        - Gather more training data.\n",
    "        - Reduce noise in the training data by fixing errors and removing outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data you've underfit your model.\n",
    "        - Select a more powerful model with more parameters\n",
    "        - Use feature engineering to feed better features to the model\n",
    "        - Reduce the constraints of the model (increase degrees of freedom, reduce regularization parameter, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : If the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations, that means the model is overfitting the data. This can be fixed by using larger dataset (if possible), making the model simpler and eliminate outliers (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : The test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. The data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. What is a validation set&#39;s purpose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Validation set is a set that you test your model (fit using training data) to see how it performs. Test set is necessary so that you can determine how good (or bad) your model performs. Validation set is also  to compare between different training models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**18. What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Cross-validation is a tool to compare models without needing a separate validation set. It is preferred over validation set because we can save from breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as having more data is valuable regardless. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : If the test set is used to tune the hyperparameters, in that case the parameters will get tuned only for the test case and hence the model will fail to generalize.  "
