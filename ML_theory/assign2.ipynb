    "**1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : All concept of human learning lies in — observing something, identifying a pattern, building a theory (model) to explain this pattern and testing this theory to check if its fits in most or all observations. For example, we learn to identify things by observing and identifying it, say to identify a bird or animal or something else. If there are some events going on, we try to observe and try to identify a pattern and build a theory for that, e.g. water cycle - evaporation - condensation - precipitation. Once the theory is built, we test the theory by some new observation and try to see if the theory is correct. Like for the above example, if there are dense clouds we will expect rain to happen. If it does not take place we need to improve our theory, i.e. not always there is rain if there is dense cloud. There are several other factors involved.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Human learning is the form of learning which requires higher order mental processes like thinking, reasoning, intelligence, etc.We learn different concepts from childhood. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Learning through Association - Classical Conditioning.\n",
    " - Learning through consequences – Operant Conditioning.\n",
    " - Learning through observation – Modeling/Observational Learning.\n",
    " \n",
    "- We can make machine learn in a very similar way. Machines are made to learn using Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Machine learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers on how to think in a similar way to how humans do, like by Learning and improving upon past experiences. It works by exploring data and identifying patterns, and involves minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Define the terms &quot;penalty&quot; and &quot;reward&quot; in the context of reinforcement learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : : A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, which may also be referred to as an agent, learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. Example: Suppose there is an AI agent present within a maze environment, and his goal is to find the diamond. The agent interacts with the environment by performing some actions, and based on those actions, the state of the agent gets changed, and it also receives a reward or penalty as feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Explain the term &quot;learning as a search&quot;?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Learning can be viewed as a search through the space of all sentences in a concept description language for a sentence that best describes the data. Alternatively, it can be viewed as a search through all hypotheses in a hypothesis space. Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis representation. The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : The Goal of machine learning, closely coupled with the goal of AI, is to achieve a through understanding about the nature of learning process (both human learning and other forms of learning), about the computational aspects of learning behaviors, and to implant the learning capability in computer systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Goals of Machine Learning. The goal of ML, in simples words, is to understand the nature of (human and  other forms of) learning, and to build learning capability in computers. To be more specific, there are three aspects of the goals of ML. \n",
    " - To make the computers smarter, more intelligent. The more direct objective in this aspect is to develop systems (programs) for specific practical learning tasks in application domains.\n",
    " - To develop computational models of human learning process and perform computer simulations. The study in this aspect is also called cognitive modeling. \n",
    " - To explore new learning methods and develop general learning algorithms independent of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have the ability to learn, however with the progress in artificial intelligence, machine learning has become a resource which can augment or even replace human learning. Learning does not happen all at once, but it builds upon and is shaped by previous knowledge. Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : 1. Image recognition - Image recognition is a well-known and widespread example of machine learning in the real world. It can identify an object as a digital image, based on the intensity of the pixels in black and white images or colour images.\n",
    "  - Real-world examples of image recognition:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Label an x-ray as cancerous or not\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Assign a name to a photographed face (aka “tagging” on social media)\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Recognise handwriting by segmenting a single letter into smaller images\n",
    "\n",
    " Machine learning is also frequently used for facial recognition within an image. Using a database of people, the system can identify commonalities and match them to faces. This is often used in law enforcement.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Speech recognition - Machine learning can translate speech into text. Certain software applications can convert live voice and recorded speech into a text file. The speech can be segmented by intensities on time-frequency bands as well.\n",
    "   - Real-world examples of speech recognition:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Voice search\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Voice dialling\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Appliance control\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common uses of speech recognition software are devices like Google Home or Amazon Alexa.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Medical diagnosis - Machine learning can help with the diagnosis of diseases. Many physicians use chatbots with speech recognition capabilities to discern patterns in symptoms.\n",
    "   - Real-world examples for medical diagnosis:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Assisting in formulating a diagnosis or recommends a treatment option\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Oncology and pathology use machine learning to recognise cancerous tissue \n",
    "\n",
    "     - Analyse bodily fluids\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of rare diseases, the joint use of facial recognition software and machine learning helps scan patient photos and identify phenotypes that correlate with rare genetic diseases.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Statistical arbitrage - Arbitrage is an automated trading strategy that’s used in finance to manage a large volume of securities. The strategy uses a trading algorithm to analyse a set of securities using economic variables and correlations.\n",
    "   - Real-world examples of statistical arbitrage:\n",

    "\n",
    "     - Identify real-time arbitrage opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning optimises the arbitrage strategy to enhance results.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Predictive analytics - Machine learning can classify available data into groups, which are then defined by rules set by analysts. When the classification is complete, the analysts can calculate the probability of a fault.\n",
    "   - Real-world examples of predictive analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Improve prediction systems to calculate the possibility of fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics is one of the most promising examples of machine learning. It's applicable for everything; from product development to real estate pricing.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. Extraction - Machine learning can extract structured information from unstructured data. Organisations amass huge volumes of data from customers. A machine learning algorithm automates the process of annotating datasets for predictive analytics tools.\n",
    "   - Real-world examples of extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Generate a model to predict vocal cord disorders\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Develop methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat the disorders\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Help physicians diagnose and treat problems quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, these processes are tedious. But machine learning can track and extract information to obtain billions of data samples. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : In Machine Learning, Abstraction is supported primarily at the level of modules. This can be justified in two ways: first, Data abstraction is mostly a question of program interfaces and therefore it arises naturally at the point where we have to consider program composition and modules. Abstraction is defined as dealing with ideas instead of events. In the context of AI, that means worrying more about what the right algorithm is and less about how to implement it. Another way of looking at it, for those technically inclined, is as an API call (abstracted) vs. a self implemented function or series of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is when we train a model to classify between dogs and cats. If the model is provided with dogs images dataset with only two breeds, it may obtain a good performance. But, it possibly gets a low classification score when it is tested by other breeds of dogs as well. This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction. In the sample above, the model may obtain 85% performance score when it is tested by only two dog breeds and gains 70% if trained by all breeds. However, the first possibly gets a very low score (e.g. 45%) if it is evaluated by an unseen dataset with all breed dogs. This for the latter can be unchanged given than it has been trained by high data diversity including all possible breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be taken into account that data diversity is not the only point to care in order to have a generalized model. It can be resulted by nature of a machine learning algorithm, or by poor hyper-parameter configuration. In this post we explain all determinant factors. There are some methods (regularization) to apply during model training to ensure about generalization. But before, we explain bias and variance as well as underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : In Machine Learning, Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label. Whereas Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    " Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).\n",
    "\n",
    " The output variables are often called labels or categories. The mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation. For example, an email of text can be classified as belonging to one of two classes: “spam“ and “not spam“.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A classification problem requires that examples be classified into one of two or more classes.\n",
    "    - A classification can have real-valued or discrete input variables.\n",
    "    - A problem with two classes is often called a two-class or binary classification problem.\n",
    "    - A problem with more than two classes is often called a multi-class classification problem.\n",
    "    - A problem where an example is assigned multiple classes is called a multi-label classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for classification models to predict a continuous value as the probability of a given example belonging to each output class. The probabilities can be interpreted as the likelihood or confidence of a given example belonging to each class. A predicted probability can be converted into a class value by selecting the class label that has the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to a continuous output variable (y). A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer or floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes. For example, a house may be predicted to sell for a specific dollar value, perhaps in the range of 200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A regression problem requires the prediction of a quantity.\n",
    "    - A regression can have real valued or discrete input variables.\n",
    "    - A problem with multiple input variables is often called a multivariate regression problem.\n",
    "    - A regression problem where input variables are ordered by time is called a time series forecasting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a regression predictive model predicts a quantity, the skill of the model must be reported as an error in those predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans:  Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning technique which is used to predict continuous values. The ultimate goal of a regression algorithm is to plot a best-fit line or a curve between the data. The three main metrics that are used for evaluating the trained regression model are Variance, Bias and Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the real-world problem which are solved using regression : \n",
    "  - Forecasting sales: Organizations often use linear regression models to forecast future sales. This can be helpful for things like budgeting and planning. Algorithms such as Amazon’s item-to-item collaborative filtering are used to predict what customers will buy in the future based on their past purchase history.\n",
    "  - Cash forecasting: Many businesses use linear regression to forecast how much cash they’ll have on hand in the future. This is important for things like managing expenses and ensuring that there is enough cash on hand to cover unexpected costs.\n",
    "  - Analyzing survey data: Linear regression can also be used to analyze survey data. This can help businesses understand things like customer satisfaction and product preferences. For example, a company might use linear regression to figure out how likely people are to recommend their product to others.\n",
    "  - Stock predictions: A lot of businesses use linear regression models to predict how stocks will perform in the future. This is done by analyzing past data on stock prices and trends to identify patterns.\n",
    "  - Predicting consumer behavior: Businesses can use linear regression to predict things like how much a customer is likely to spend. Regression models can also be used to predict consumer behavior. This can be helpful for things like targeted marketing and product development. For example, Walmart uses linear regression to predict what products will be popular in different regions of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters. Clustering is the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects.\n",
    "\n",
    " Important Points are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    " A cluster of data objects can be treated as one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "    While doing cluster analysis, we first partition the set of data into groups based on data similarity and then assign the labels to the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main advantage of clustering over classification is that, it is adaptable to changes and helps single out useful features that distinguish different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Applications of Cluster Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Clustering analysis is broadly used in many applications such as market research, pattern recognition, data analysis, and image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Clustering can also help marketers discover distinct groups in their customer base. And they can characterize their customer groups based on the purchasing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the field of biology, it can be used to derive plant and animal taxonomies, categorize genes with similar functionalities and gain insight into structures inherent to populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Clustering also helps in identification of areas of similar land use in an earth observation database. It also helps in the identification of groups of houses in a city according to house type, value, and geographic location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data mining function, cluster analysis serves as a tool to gain insight into the distribution of data to observe characteristics of each cluster. Clustering methods can be classified into the following categories\n",
    "\n",
    " - Partitioning Method\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hierarchical Method\n",
    "\n",
    " - Density-based Method\n",
    "\n",
    " - Grid-Based Method\n",
    "\n",
    " - Model-Based Method Constraint-based Method\n",

    "**13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:   \n",
    "i. Machine learning algorithms are used  \n",
    "ii. Studying under supervision  \n",
    "iii. Studying without supervision  \n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ans : \n",
    "- Machine learning algorithms are used: At its Most basic, Machine Learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing intelligence over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Studying Under Supervision: In machine learning, there are two important categories- Supervised and Unsupervised learning.Supervised learning, an algorithm learns from a training dataset. We know the correct answers or desired output, the algorithm makes predictions using the given dataset and is corrected by the “supervisor”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Studying without supervision : Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning : Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning. Here, agents are self-trained on reward and punishment mechanisms. It’s about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment through observations in a specific situation. It acts as a signal to positive and negative behaviors. Essentially an agent (or several) is built that can perceive and interpret the environment in which is placed, furthermore, it can take actions and interact with it."
